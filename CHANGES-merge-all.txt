Important note about "merge-all" branch
=======================================

Goal of the rather experimental "merge-all" branch is to merge all the stuff:
- changesets from "merge" branch
- features that DO IMPACT compatibility with original attic
- etc.

THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH ORIGINAL ATTIC OR PREVIOUS
"merge-all" CODE nor THAT YOU CAN SWITCH BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ORIGINAL CODE
OR PREVIOUS "merge-all" CODE AND THIS CODE WITHIN THE SAME REPOSITORY WITHOUT
ENCOUNTERING SEVERE ISSUES.

Please also see the LICENSE for more informations.


Stuff in "merge-all" that is not in "merge" minus minor changes
===============================================================

added tuning docs

attic init --compression NN --cipher NN --mac NN ...
(see attic init --help)

new hashes:      sha512-256
                 sha512
                 sha1
                 ghash (default)
new MACs:        hmac-sha512-256
                 hmac-sha512
                 hmac-sha1
                 gmac (default)
new ciphers:     aes256-ctr + hmac-sha512-256
                 aes256-gcm (default)
new compression: no compression (default)
                 zlib level 1..9 (previously, level 6 was hardcoded)
                 lzma preset 0..9
                 lz4 (and other) multi-threaded algos from blosc library

source: more flexible type 0x03 header format, allowing to give hash algo,
compression algo and level, encryption algo, key type.

IV is stored in full length, length of stored IV/MAC/hash is flexible.
Indexing key size (key = id_hash()) is flexible and configurable per repo.

source: less hardcoding, numeric offsets / lengths
source: flexible hashing, compression, encryption, key dispatching
